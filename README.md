# Komfortfunktionen-Haptik-Demo
A user-interface prototype demo for BMW dashboard -- combines capacitive touch, physical tact switches, and a separate display

The graphics and photos used in this project are proprietary to BMW, so they are unavailable here.


Harware used in this project:
---------------
    - Arduino Mega 2560
    - OT1106 Evaluation Kit PCB from Atmel (capacitive touch breakout boards)
    - Tact switches
        --> Each tact switch was actuated by a board with an array of touch-sensitive areas ("buttons")
        --> Conductive foil underneath each "button" acted as the capacitive touch electrode
    - A mounting board to mount all "button" arrays
    - Computer (to run the Processing code and display the user interface)
